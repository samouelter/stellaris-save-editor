What does it do ?
-
This tool will allow you to edit the galaxy map of your game, by swapping two systems together.
You want the replace boring old Bernard's Star with Wenkwort Artem ? You can.

How does it work ?
-
You select the save you want edit, the program will extract the data from your save.
Once you have selected the two systems you want swapped, the program will edit the savefile accordingly and create you
a new savefile. The galaxy maps coordinates are swapped, so are the hyperlanes.

How to use :
-
1) You can launch the program directly by command line : "java -jar stellaris-save-editor.jar" or directly by clicking the .jar
I recommand using the command line because you will be able to see if the programm is having any problem.
2) You will be asked to select the savefile you want to edit, by default the saves are located at : 'C:\Users\yourname\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\save games'
3) In the main window, you can :
   - change the name of the futur savefile,
   - open the swap dialog window,
   - 1) Enter the two system ids you want to swap, you can find them ingame by using the "debugtooltip" console command and hovering over the system.
     2) Press swap to swap the two systems. You can swap multiples times before leaving the dialog window.
     3) If you press save, your changes will be validated, and you will go back to the starting screen
     4) If you press exit, your changes will not be validated, and you will go back to the starting screen
   - press save to create a new savefile with your changes. 
   - exit to leave the program without doing anything
4) Locate your savefile in game and load it !
